g lib for javascript function extend

This module is a function extend for jquery , backbone and some module else .

The lib is aim to provide a extension or improvement for js lib . 

A lot of useful js libraries have give us many convinence to code Front-End project . But we still find hard when we want to solve some usual problem . We need to code a lot or iterate function creation . 

So I set this lib and improve by my daily work . 

I divided the lib into several part , which can be used independant .

base.js is the core function. The others are extend it . They may rely on some js that I have list in the front of the js file .
